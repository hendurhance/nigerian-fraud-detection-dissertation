## Abstract
Nigeria's electronic payment transactions reached N600 trillion in 2023, representing a 55\% increase from the previous year, yet sophisticated fraud detection mechanisms remain underdeveloped in the Nigerian banking sector. This research develops and evaluates supervised machine learning models for fraud risk scoring using a simulated dataset of 1,000,000 Nigerian financial transactions, calibrated to realistic banking patterns using NIBSS fraud landscape data. Three supervised learning algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, were implemented and compared using 38 engineered features encompassing temporal patterns, behavioral analytics, and Nigerian-specific risk indicators. While XGBoost achieved superior statistical performance with F1-Score of 0.854 and 74.6\% recall compared to Random Forest's 0.699 and 53.8\% recall, Random Forest demonstrated marginally higher AUC-ROC of 0.977 [0.966, 0.986] versus XGBoost's 0.973. Cost-sensitive analysis revealed Random Forest's superior economic value, reducing fraud-related costs by 69.1\% compared to XGBoost's 43.7\% through optimal threshold selection. SHAP analysis identified amount-based features as dominant fraud indicators, with Web banking (0.34\%) and Mobile banking (0.33\%) emerging as highest-risk channels, consistent with documented NIBSS patterns. This study demonstrates that ensemble methods provide superior fraud detection capabilities for Nigerian banking contexts when combined with appropriate feature engineering and threshold optimization. The research establishes the first publicly available Nigerian financial fraud detection dataset and production-ready framework, addressing a critical gap in African financial fraud research. The synthetic data approach successfully balances research validity with ethical compliance, providing a replicable methodology for emerging market fraud detection research with immediate implementation value for Nigerian financial institutions
